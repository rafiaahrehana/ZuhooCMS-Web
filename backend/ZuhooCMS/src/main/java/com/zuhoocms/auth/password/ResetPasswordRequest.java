// Two mutually-exclusive ways to prove the request is legitimate, checked in
// AuthServiceImpl.resetPassword():
//  - email + code: the "forgot password" numeric-code flow.
//  - token: the long-lived JWT link ClientServiceImpl.invite() emails to set an
//    initial portal password. Left as-is; the invite email links straight into
//    this same endpoint and switching it to a code would break that flow, since
//    the client never went through a "forgot password" step to receive one.
