/**
 * Fields an employee may edit on their OWN Employee record via PATCH /api/employees/me -
 * deliberately a narrow subset of UpdateEmployeeRequest. Job title, department, designation,
 * employment type/status, salary, bank details, hire dates, and date of birth are HR/owner-
 * managed only (EMPLOYEE_UPDATE via PATCH /api/employees/{id}) - letting an employee self-edit
 * those would let them change their own pay or job standing. National ID and Tax ID are
 * self-reported personal identity fields (the employee is the authority on their own ID
 * numbers), so those stay self-editable alongside the rest of the personal-info fields.
