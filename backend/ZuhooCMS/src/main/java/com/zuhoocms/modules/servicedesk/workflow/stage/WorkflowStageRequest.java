/**
 * BUG-FIX SUMMARY
 * ───────────────
 * assigneeRole changed from Role enum to String — WorkflowStage.assigneeRole is annotated
 * @Column(length = 100) and declared as String. Storing a Role enum here is wrong because:
 *   a) The column is a plain VARCHAR — no @Enumerated annotation on the base field.
 *   b) WorkflowStage is a workflow configuration object; the assignee role is a flexible
 *      label (e.g. "ADMIN", "STAFF", "REVIEWER") that may not map 1:1 to the Role enum,
 *      especially as the system evolves.
 *   c) The mapper does stage.setAssigneeRole(request.getAssigneeRole()) — if request has
 *      Role and base has String, this is a compile error.
 *
 * Keeping it as String preserves the existing database schema and gives maximum flexibility.
 * The Angular frontend can validate against a fixed list on its end.
