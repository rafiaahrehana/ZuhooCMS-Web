/**

 * <ul>
 *   <li>no record at all — the employee never checked in;</li>
 *   <li>a record with a check-in but no check-out — an unfinished day is not
 *       counted as attendance.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Shared by {@code DailyAbsenteeScheduler} (nightly backfill) and the manual
 * admin backfill endpoint.
 *
 * Every marking pass is idempotent: a record already marked ABSENT, or one with
 * both a check-in and a check-out, is left untouched. These are all skipped —
 * company holidays, the employee's weekly-off day (from their assigned shift),
 * approved leave, future dates, and any date before the employee's hire date.
