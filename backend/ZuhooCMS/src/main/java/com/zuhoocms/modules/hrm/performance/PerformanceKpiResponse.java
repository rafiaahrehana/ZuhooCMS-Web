/**
 * Objective KPIs for one employee over a review period, aggregated from the
 * modules that actually own the data - attendance, leave, service-desk tasks,
 * service requests and client reviews.
 *
 * Nothing here is stored on the review itself. It is recomputed on read, so a
 * review opened today reflects the same period the same way it did last week.
 *
 * Fields are nullable on purpose: null means "no data for this period", which
 * the UI must render as a dash rather than as a zero. An employee with no
 * client reviews has an unknown satisfaction score, not a satisfaction of 0.
