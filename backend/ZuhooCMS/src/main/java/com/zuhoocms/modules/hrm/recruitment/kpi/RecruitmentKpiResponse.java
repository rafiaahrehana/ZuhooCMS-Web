/**
 * Everything the Recruitment Reports &amp; KPIs page renders, in one round
 * trip - same shape convention as HrDashboardResponse: counts that can
 * legitimately be zero are primitives, rates/averages that may be genuinely
 * UNKNOWN (no data to divide yet) are boxed Double and left null so the UI
 * shows a dash rather than a misleading 0%.
 *
 * Computed live from JobApplication's CURRENT status only - there is no
 * stage-transition history table, so "reached interview" etc. is inferred
 * from where an application sits (or last sat) in the forward pipeline
 * order, not from an actual audit trail. See RecruitmentKpiServiceImpl.
