/**
 * Everything the HR dashboard renders, in one round trip.
 *
 * Aggregated live on read. Nothing here is stored, so the numbers always agree
 * with the underlying employee, attendance, leave and payroll records rather
 * than with a snapshot that has since drifted.
 *
 * Counts that could legitimately be zero are primitives. Values that may be
 * genuinely UNKNOWN are boxed and left null so the UI can show a dash - an
 * attendance rate of null ("nothing recorded today") must not render as 0%.
