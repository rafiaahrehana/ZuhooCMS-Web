 * Strips characters that providers reject inside a JSON string body - control

 *
 * It deliberately does NOT escape backslashes or rewrite double quotes: the
 * outgoing body is serialised by Jackson via RestTemplate, which escapes both
 * correctly. Doing it here as well double-escaped every backslash and turned
 * every quote in the user's prompt into an apostrophe, corrupting code snippets
 * and quoted text before the model ever saw them.
