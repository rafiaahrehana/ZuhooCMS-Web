/**
 * A push target: one row per app install that has registered for notifications.
 *
 * The token is unique because FCM can hand the same token to a different account on the same
 * device after a reinstall or account switch — re-registering must move the row to the new user
 * rather than leave the old one pointing at a device that no longer belongs to them.
 *
 * companyId is denormalised the same way Notification does it, so a tenant's tokens can be
 * scoped without joining through the user.
